# Cluster Insight
This project implements KMeans clustering to group data into clusters and evaluates the model by comparing clustering results with actual target labels.

## Description
This project develops a clustering algorithm using KMeans to divide the dataset into clusters and evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy. The dataset contains two features and target labels, allowing for a comparison between clustering results and actual target values, along with a visual analysis. The KMeans algorithm determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and assesses the results based on accuracy metrics. Visualization of the results shows how well the algorithm performed and highlights areas where instances from different classes intersect, revealing a limitation of the KMeans method.

The project also includes data preprocessing, missing value checks, and graphical comparisons of true targets with predicted clusters.
